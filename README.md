# Bike-Sharing-Demand

Overview

Bike sharing systems are a means of renting bicycles where the process of obtaining
membership, rental, and bike return is automated via a network of kiosk locations
throughout a city. Using these systems, people are able rent a bike from a one location
and return it to a different place on an as-needed basis.
Bike-sharing rental process is highly correlated to the environmental and seasonal settings.
For instance, weather conditions,
precipitation, day of week, season, hour of the day, etc. can affect the rental behaviors.
